Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Upgrade your ship with items from shop!
Be careful. Hitpoints mustn't go down to 0!

Good luck!`;

const guide = `Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Each npc is in several times stronger than 
the previous one (from top to bottom).

If hitpoints (green line) drop to 0, your 
ship will be destroyed and progress lost.

Enemy kills give you exp, btc and plt.
With btc and plt buy equipment in shop. 
Experience increase your lvl and rank.

Guns increase your damage, that means you kill npc 
faster and get less damage during fight. 
Shields and ship upgrades increase your total hitpoints.

You can have maximum 5 guns and shields, 
but each drone increases that number!

Fastrep heals you depending on your hp amount.
Emp increases miss probability.
Wshield decreases incoming damage.  
Don't use emp and wshield in same time.

Promocode: "p4f".

For PC players there are few key bindings:
"Q" for autofarm.
"P" to open/close menu.`;
